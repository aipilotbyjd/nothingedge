                                user-friendly. Color schemes, typography, and imagery are carefully selected to convey the
                                brand‚Äôs identity and values effectively.</p>
                            </p>
                            <p>Accessibility considerations are addressed, making sure the website is usable for people with
                                disabilities. This phase is collaborative. It requires ongoing communication between
                                designers, developers, and stakeholders.</p>

                                visitors. It includes blog posts, product descriptions, videos, and infographics.</p>
                            <p>This phase ensures the website not only looks good but also delivers value to its audience.
                                It helps in establishing a solid foundation for online presence and brand identity.</p>
